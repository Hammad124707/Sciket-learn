import sklearn

we cant apply pandas methods and attribute on datasets related to sklearn so that we have to change the sciketlearn data in pandas data frame

iris.data   #all the data except values of x
iris.target #our target column only
iris.target_names #tells us hamare pass kon kon se target hein like 0,1,2. saari classes ke baree mein batata he
iris.feature_names #tellss us tha name of every column


First we have estimators
each estimator has a fit method

Secodnly we have transformers
each preprocessors and transformer has a method known as transformer instead of fit method


basically both of them have a same parent class known as BaseEstimator


Cross validation: It is used to check the accuracy of our 

Calling Models : from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegiression

Dimentionality Reduction: when we have to reduce the features in our dataset
